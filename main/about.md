| <img src="/assets/images/Sparky.jpg" alt="Sparky" class="picture" /> | | <span style="color:#777;"> We are a diverse group of high school students that have many different abilities which help us to work together and form a great team. We work well together creating an amazing robot to compete in FIRST Regional tournaments. We come from ninth through twelfth grade and have different personalities, which encourages us to discuss and have many ideas for building this year's robot. <br/><br/> This is "The Varsity Sport for the Mind." The Robotics Team combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.  It’s as close to "real-world engineering" as a student can get. <br/><br> FIRST promotes education and teamwork through the use of science and technology. This program helps young adults get involved in the up and coming field of technology. Because this world is evolving and are becoming more dependent on computers; by our association with FIRST, we can be better equipped to handle our technologically advanced world. <br/><br/> There is a place for everyone in this program, even if math and science is not your forte. BEASTBot members are active in volunteering, helping the community, managing marketing and logistics etc. </span> |
