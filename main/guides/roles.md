## What you can do in Robotics:
---
### Technial:

- Build <button type="button" onclick="showHide('build')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="build" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
Build is designing and actually putting together the robot, building the frame, any arms or other additional parts we decide to have on the robot.
</span>

- Wiring <button type="button" onclick="showHide('wiring')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="wiring" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
Wiring is connecting all the electrical components that allow us to actually control the robot, and any pneumatics is we decide to use them.
</span>

- Programming <button type="button" onclick="showHide('programming')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="programming" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
Programming is coding the logic that lets the robot respond to our controllers.
</span>

- Bumpers <button type="button" onclick="showHide('bumpers')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="bumpers" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
Bumper Boys with a Z! We've got this covered for this year, but somone'll have to do it next year... We'll make a tutorial for it that we'll stick on the website.
</span>

- CAD <button type="button" onclick="showHide('cad')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="cad" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
We should try to CAD out some 3D models of our robot this year to help us better know how we want to build our robot.
</span>

- Drive <button type="button" onclick="showHide('drive')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="drive" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
Phil was our main driver last year, but he will not be able to drive this year due to other things happening during the tournament.<br/>
We will need two drivers and a human player, Ben & Peter are able to drive, but if anyone else is interested, once we have the robot built enough we will let people try driving the the robot.
</span>

### Non-Technical:

- Website <button type="button" onclick="showHide('website')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="website" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
Ben's got this covered pretty well (I'd say this is a decent website, right?), but if someone's interested in web design you might be able to help. If someone wants to help with the News page, that'd be nice as I'm not great at that kinda stuff... I can maybe get you the ability to edit the site, or you can just [email me](mailto:epicpkmn11@outlook.com) things to put on there. I'd like to keep that page active as it'll probably make us look good to potenital sponsors or anyone else who visits our site if we seem to be active.
</span>

- Social Media <button type="button" onclick="showHide('socialMedia')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="socialMedia" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
BEASTBot has an Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, and YouTube.<br/>
Ben's currently running the Instagram and Twitter, with the occasional YouTube video (hi .o/), but I'm probably the least qualified person to be running a social media [;P](https://www.sudomemo.net/user/15BDEEA0A0E19B5B@DSi), so if anyone's interested you'd probably be better than me<br/>
We should post videos that make our robot / us seem cool to YouTube (along the lines of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXhDWZ8PeA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvQyp2uRJSU), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgWryU1nMHw))<br/>
For Twitter and Instagram we should just try to post some pictures of our robots, 3D printers, and any other cool things we have, or other public team status update kinda things (That is what people do on social media, right?).<br/>
I (Ben) have no idea what/who/when/where/why you do a SnapChat (iOS 6 all the way!), so if you want to post something on there, go ahead... I don't even know if we have any posts yet...
</span>

- Recruitment <button type="button" onclick="showHide('recruitment')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="recruitment" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
We need as many people as we can get, and currently a lot of our members are Seniors who will be graduating at the end of this year. If we want this team to survive next year we're going to *need* to recruit some more people this year.<br/>
If you know anyone who might be interested in robotics please invite them to come to a meeting.
</span>

- Sponsors <button type="button" onclick="showHide('sponsors')">More info</button><br/>
<span id="sponsors" style="display:none" class="hiddenThing">
If we can get more sponsors, that will help us be able to afford better parts for our robot, more regional tournaments, and other good things. If you know any businesses or anything / anyone else who may want to sponsor us, let Fischer / leadership know.<br/>
If you want to contact potential sponsors, we know of a few businesses and colleges who we talked to at the MN State Fair, but leadership has been too busy to get in contact with them, so if you'd be able to contact sponsors please do!
