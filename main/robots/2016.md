				Sparky did an amazing job, ranking 12th at the 10,000 Lakes Regional in Williams Arena. He made it to the quarterfinals and won one of the matches before losing to the number 2 alliance by 8 points. He did so well that he helped secure his spot at the Minnesota State High School League Championships on May 21st.

				He ranked 13th at the Minnesota State High School League Championship. He and his driver had an amazing last match, where Sparky lost connection to the field, then, once rebooted, crossed two defenses, and parked on the batter within 30 seconds to secure a breach and a capture and win the match.
<br/><br/>
				Sparky had a fun Halloween in 2018, where he dressed up as a spooky ghost at the AFAA allergy free zone at the MOA.
