				Our robot for the year of 2018, Sketch E competed in the game <em>FIRST POWER UP</em>. Sketch E's main feature is it's large linear slide located right in the middle of the robot. With this it's able to grab *Power Cubes* off the ground and quickly lift them up over 6ft in the air so it can drop them onto the Scale.
<br/><br/>
				<a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2855/2018" target="_blank">Sketch E</a> was only able to compete in one official tournament, the <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018mnmi2" target="_blank"><em>Minnesota North Star Regional</em></a> in which it, unfortunatly, placed 54th with a record of 1-9-0.
<br/><br/>
				We then participated in the the <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018mnri" target="_blank">2018 Minnesota Robotics Invitational</a>, where we placed 26<sup>th</sup> out of 36 teams. (Better than <a href="/main/?robots/2016">Sparky</a> placed in Qualifications back in 2016 when it was on the winning alligence!) Unfortunately, however, we were not picked for Eliminations...
